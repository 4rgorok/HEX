I was just playing arround with node express and three.js

You can create and save a map with lights and some entities by clicking on the hexagons
and then see its 3D render by clicking 'GO TO GAME!" button.

Once in the "game" you can change intencity and height of the light sources and move the camera
with your mouse.

To run the "game" you need to run "node server.js" (assuming you have node installed" in the command line
and then access it through http://localhost:3000/ on the browser.
